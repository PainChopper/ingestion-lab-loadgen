# ingestion-lab-loadgen

Load generator for ingestion-lab experiments.

This utility is used to model and control synthetic load
(rate, pulse, burst) and observe generator behavior under
different conditions.

The focus is on predictable behavior, explicit state control,
and simple observability, not on producing realistic payloads.
